# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! This portfolio showcases my projects, skills, and experience as a developer.

- Styling is done with React Bootstrap, a front-end library that provides pre-built components for building responsive, mobile-first websites with the popular Bootstrap framework.
- React Bottstrap is used for the tabs component.
- Reacte animate.css is used to animate the projects images.
- React React-On-Screen is used to wrap the projects images and assures the visibility animation.
- For the skills section I used the package from React called carousel.
